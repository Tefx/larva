# larva-opencode-plugin

Bridges larva's PersonaSpec registry to opencode's agent system.

## How it works

```
Startup (config hook):
  1. Load tool-policy.json (optional deny/allow rules)
  2. larva export --all --json → get all persona specs in one call
  3. Register as opencode agents with permissions mapped
  4. Pre-cache prompts

Runtime (per API call):
  chat.params → detect larva agent → apply temperature (if set)
  system.transform → replace placeholder with full prompt + watermark
  (re-resolves from larva CLI only on cache expiry, 5 min)
```

## Install

```jsonc
// .opencode/opencode.json (project) or ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json (global)
{
  "plugin": ["file:///path/to/larva/contrib/opencode-plugin/larva.ts"]
}
```

larva CLI resolution (zero config):
1. If cwd is a larva project (pyproject.toml with `name = "larva"`) → `uv run --project . larva`
2. `larva` in PATH → direct
3. Fallback → `uvx larva`

## Permission mapping

### From PersonaSpec (larva)

| PersonaSpec | opencode permission | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| `capabilities: {fs: "read_only", git: "read_only"}` | `edit: deny, bash: deny` | If ALL capabilities are none/read_only |
| `capabilities: {fs: "read_write"}` | no restrictions | ANY read_write/destructive = no restriction |
| ~~`side_effect_policy: read_only`~~ | `edit: deny, bash: deny` | Historical compatibility input only; prefer `capabilities` |
| ~~`side_effect_policy: approval_required`~~ | `edit: ask, bash: ask` | Historical compatibility input only; prefer `capabilities` |
| ~~`side_effect_policy: allow`~~ | no restrictions | Historical compatibility input only |
| `can_spawn: false` | `task: deny` | |

**ADR-002 Note:** `side_effect_policy` is a historical compatibility input for this
plugin and is rejected at the larva canonical admission boundary. The plugin prefers
`capabilities` for permission derivation. For larva admission semantics, see
`INTERFACES.md`; for migration background, see ADR-002.

### From tool-policy.json (runtime)

Per-agent deny/allow rules for specific opencode tools. This is **not** part of the persona definition — it's runtime enforcement (tela's job in the full opifex system, approximated here for opencode).

**Search order:**
1. `.opencode/tool-policy.json` (project-level)
2. `~/.config/opencode/tool-policy.json` (global)

**Format:**
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "python-senior": {
      "deny": ["vectl_vectl_claim", "vectl_vectl_mutate"]
    },
    "wiring-auditor": {
      "deny": ["write", "edit"]
    },
    "vectl-orchestrator": {
      "deny": ["serena_*", "read", "edit", "write", "glob", "grep"]
    }
  }
}
```

If the file doesn't exist, no tool restrictions are applied beyond what larva's
`capabilities` and `can_spawn` provide. `side_effect_policy` is rejected at the
larva canonical admission boundary and must not be treated as a live PersonaSpec
input.

## Other mappings

| PersonaSpec | opencode Agent | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| `id` | agent name | direct |
| `description` | `description` | prefixed with `[larva]` |
| `prompt` | system prompt | injected on-demand via system.transform |
| `model` | `model` | passed as-is |
| `model_params.temperature` | `temperature` | only if explicitly set |

### Not mapped

| PersonaSpec | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| `tools` | Historical migration field; larva canonical admission rejects it and uses `capabilities` instead |
| `capabilities` | Used for permission derivation (see above) |
| `model_params.max_tokens` | opencode manages per-provider |
| `compaction_prompt` | opencode has its own compaction system |

## Watermark

Every larva-loaded prompt includes:

```xml
<larva-persona id="python-senior" />
```

## Limitations

- Agent list is fixed at startup. New `larva register` requires opencode restart.
- `capabilities` field is used for permission derivation but does not map 1:1 to opencode tool names.
- Temperature is only applied if larva persona explicitly sets it.
