# larva -- Interface Specification

## Purpose

`larva` validates, assembles, normalizes, and registers canonical PersonaSpec
artifacts.

It is a downstream admission and projection handler, not the contract owner.
The canonical PersonaSpec schema authority is `opifex`. `larva` implements
validation, normalization, and registry projection as a consumer of the opifex
canonical contract.

## PersonaSpec Contract

Normative shape:

```json
{
  "id": "developer",
  "description": "Local coding persona",
  "prompt": "...",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4",
  "capabilities": {
    "filesystem": "read_write",
    "git": "read_only"
  },
  "can_spawn": false,
  "spec_version": "0.1.0",
  "spec_digest": "sha256:..."
}
```

### Field Details

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Required. Unique identifier matching `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$` |
| `description` | string | Required. Human-readable description of the persona |
| `prompt` | string | Required. System prompt defining persona behavior |
| `model` | string | Required. Model identifier (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4") |
| `capabilities` | dict[str, ToolPosture] | Required. **Canonical** capability declaration: tool family -> posture. Empty `{}` means no declared capability postures, not unrestricted capability access. |
| `tools` | dict[str, ToolPosture] | **Rejected** at admission boundary — never accepted as canonical input |
| `model_params` | dict | Additional model parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.) |
| `side_effect_policy` | string | **Rejected** at admission boundary — not a PersonaSpec field |
| `can_spawn` | bool \| list[str] | Whether persona can spawn sub-agents, or list of allowed persona IDs |
| `compaction_prompt` | string | Prompt used for state compaction |
| `spec_version` | string | Required. Spec format version (must be "0.1.0") |
| `spec_digest` | string | SHA-256 digest of canonical JSON representation |

### ToolPosture Values

Valid capability posture values (from `ToolPosture` in `src/larva/core/spec.py`):
- `"none"` — No tool access
- `"read_only"` — Read-only tool operations
- `"read_write"` — Read and write tool operations
- `"destructive"` — Tools that may cause irreversible side effects

### Key Rules
- `capabilities` is `family -> posture` (canonical field, defined by opifex)
- `capabilities: {}` means the persona declares no capability postures; it must not be interpreted as "all capabilities" or unrestricted runtime access
- `tools` is rejected at admission boundary — not part of canonical PersonaSpec
- `side_effect_policy` is rejected at admission boundary — belongs to runtime controls
- runtime controls are not PersonaSpec fields
- gateway profile semantics are not PersonaSpec fields
- larva validates against the opifex canonical schema; it does not define the schema

## MCP Surface

Primary MCP tools:
- `larva_validate(spec)`
- `larva_assemble(components)`
- `larva_register(spec)`
- `larva_resolve(id, overrides?)`
- `larva_list()`
- `larva_update(id, patches)`
- `larva_update_batch(where, patches, dry_run?)`
- `larva_clone(source_id, new_id)`
- `larva_delete(id)`
- `larva_clear(confirm)`
- `larva_export(all?, ids?)`
- `larva_component_list()`
- `larva_component_show(type, name)`

All MCP PersonaSpec-bearing tools reject forbidden legacy vocabulary:
`tools`, `side_effect_policy`. Unknown top-level fields such as `variables`
are also rejected.

## CLI Surface

Representative CLI operations:
- validate a PersonaSpec
- assemble a PersonaSpec from components
- register a canonical persona
- resolve or list canonical personas
- launch OpenCode with registry personas projected as agents

CLI is an operator interface over the same canonical contract. It does not add
new persona semantics.

`larva opencode [OPENCODE_ARG ...]` is a shell pass-through launcher. It exports
registered personas through the application facade, builds a child-process
`OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`, injects the larva OpenCode plugin, and then execs the
real `opencode` binary. A leading `--` after `opencode` is accepted as an
optional separator and stripped before forwarding. The command must not write
`.opencode/opencode.json` or reinterpret PersonaSpec fields.

OpenCode startup projection is not runtime semantic authority. `export --all`
is used only to make current Larva base ids visible during OpenCode startup;
per-request prompt, temperature, and permission refreshes resolve the selected
placeholder id via `larva resolve <id> --json`. The plugin cache is
last-known-good performance state keyed by base id, deduplicates concurrent
same-id resolves, may fall back to a stale previous prompt only with debug-visible
warning, and otherwise fails closed rather than leaking a `[larva:<id>]`
placeholder. Hot-update scope is limited to prompt, temperature, tool-policy,
`capabilities`, and `can_spawn`; added/deleted base ids and model/provider
startup fields require an OpenCode restart. There is no `larva-active` agent and
no global active variant state.

## Cross-Surface Authority Rules

- [Proven] `src/larva/shell/web.py` is the authoritative packaged REST surface.
- [Proven] `contrib/web/server.py` is a supported extension consumer and local
  review runtime, not the packaged contract owner.
- [Proven] Component-query semantics (`component_type` normalization, accepted
  aliases, and lookup meaning) are transport-neutral and must stay centralized
  outside adapter-local HTTP/MCP/CLI/Python envelopes.
- [Proven] CLI, MCP, packaged Web, contrib Web, and Python API may each keep
  adapter-local rendering, envelopes, and runtime hooks as long as they do not
  redefine shared semantic meaning.
- [Proven] `src/larva/core/patch.py` dotted-path patch semantics and
  `src/larva/app/facade.py` dotted lookup for batch `where` clauses remain
  separate authorities unless later evidence proves they should merge.

### Web Runtime Surface

The web surface has two runnable entrypoints with one authoritative packaged
contract:

- `larva serve` -> authoritative packaged runtime and web contract
- `python contrib/web/server.py` -> supported contributor convenience runtime for local review; not the canonical packaged entrypoint
- preserved runnable liveness proof for both entrypoints is kept with the test-suite artifacts in `tests/shell/artifacts/web_runtime_liveness.md`

#### Startup contract

`larva serve`:

- binds `127.0.0.1` via uvicorn
- defaults to port `7400`
- accepts `--port <int>` and `--no-open`
- serves `src/larva/shell/web_ui.html` at `/`

`python contrib/web/server.py`:

- requires `fastapi` and `uvicorn` in the active environment
- defaults to port `7400`
- accepts `--port <int>` and `--no-open`
- serves `contrib/web/index.html` at `/`

#### Normative endpoint inventory

These endpoints are the authoritative REST contract for the packaged web
surface:

| Method | Path | Contract |
|-------|------|----------|
| `GET` | `/` | Return the packaged HTML UI artifact |
| `GET` | `/api/personas` | Return `{data: PersonaSummary[]}` |
| `GET` | `/api/personas/{persona_id}` | Return `{data: PersonaSpec}` or a 400 error payload |
| `POST` | `/api/personas` | Accept a PersonaSpec or `{spec: PersonaSpec}`; validate then register |
| `PATCH` | `/api/personas/{persona_id}` | Accept patch object; reject protected `id`, `spec_version`, and `spec_digest` with `FORBIDDEN_PATCH_FIELD`; revalidate before register |
| `DELETE` | `/api/personas/{persona_id}` | Return `{data: {id, deleted}}` |
| `POST` | `/api/personas/clear` | Accept `{confirm}` and clear only on valid confirmation |
| `POST` | `/api/personas/validate` | Accept PersonaSpec candidate and return validation report |
| `POST` | `/api/personas/assemble` | Accept assembly request body and return assembled PersonaSpec |
| `POST` | `/api/personas/export` | Accept `{all: true}` or `{ids: [str]}`; mutually exclusive selectors; return `{data: [PersonaSpec]}` |
| `POST` | `/api/personas/update_batch` | Accept `{where: dict, patches: dict, dry_run?: bool}`; match-by-selector batch update; reject protected patch fields |
| `GET` | `/api/components` | Return available prompt/toolset/constraint/model names |
| `GET` | `/api/components/{component_type}/{name}` | Return one component or a typed HTTP error |
| `GET` | `/api/components/projection` | Return UI-only component-kind projection metadata (display labels, descriptions) |

### PersonaSummary Shape

`PersonaSummary` is returned by `GET /api/personas` (list operation):

```json
{
  "id": "developer",
  "description": "Local coding persona",
  "spec_digest": "sha256:...",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4"
}
```

Component-kind rule for public surfaces:

- [Proven] Canonical `component_type` vocabulary is `prompts | toolsets | constraints | models`.
- [Proven] Public surfaces accept only canonical plural values at ingress; singular aliases are rejected.
- [Proven] Public docs and valid-type enumerations advertise only canonical plural values.

Shared response envelope rules:

- success responses return `{"data": ...}`
- `LarvaApiError` maps to HTTP 400 with `{"error": ...}`
- component type validation may also raise typed HTTP errors from FastAPI

#### Convenience-only UI behavior

These behaviors are visible in the browser UI and covered only at convenience-UI
fidelity, not as separate normative API guarantees:

- prompt copy affordance is present in the served HTML and uses the browser clipboard API
- success icon feedback after copy is local UI state only
- browser auto-open on startup is operator convenience only
- the packaged single-page compose flow uses output-first copy (`Compose Persona`,
  `Output Persona ID`) while still submitting the unchanged canonical assemble
  request body to `POST /api/personas/assemble`
- toolsets are presented in that compose flow as capability presets; this is UI
  terminology only and does not rename the canonical `toolsets` backend field
- constraints are not exposed as a top-level picker in the compose flow;
  instead, behavior-preset affordances may prefill `can_spawn` and
  `compaction_prompt` while keeping both fields directly editable before submit
  and preserving the unchanged canonical `constraints` input on the request body
- the packaged single-page detail pane presents `can_spawn` as a three-state
  `SPAWN POLICY` control that maps UI state to the unchanged canonical field:
  `None -> false`, `Any -> true`, `Specific -> list[str]`
- `Specific` mode shows the listed-persona tag editor and preserves list-mode
  editing as convenience UI behavior over the canonical `bool | list[str]`
  schema; this does not change the underlying PersonaSpec contract
- sidebar summary rows prefer persona description as the secondary line; when a
  description is absent the UI shows a muted empty-description fallback instead
  of substituting digest text into the list view
- multi-line text fields in the detail pane (`description`,
  `compaction_prompt`, and the prompt body) use multi-line editing surfaces;
  staged edits remain local until the shared save bar is used
- prompt detail toggles use `Edit/Close` and `Full JSON/Detail` wording; the
  `Full JSON` view is a convenience inspection mode for the entire resolved
  persona document and should not interrupt active prompt editing
- staged-change highlighting for editable chips and sections uses one shared
  visual treatment rather than field-specific inline styling, so local edits are
  recognizable without implying immediate persistence

#### Contrib-only convenience surface

The supported direct script runtime exposes one extra convenience endpoint
that is not part of the authoritative packaged contract:

| Method | Path | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| `POST` | `/api/personas/batch-update` | contrib-only convenience surface |

This `/api/personas/batch-update` endpoint (hyphenated path) is a contributor
convenience alias for the packaged `/api/personas/update_batch` (underscored
path). The packaged `update_batch` endpoint is the normative REST contract;
`batch-update` exists only in `contrib/web/server.py` for local review use.

Downstream test scope should treat `/api/personas/batch-update` and its related
UI hooks as separate contrib coverage rather than normative `larva serve`
contract coverage.

## Assembly Contract

Assembly may combine:
- prompt fragments
- capability bundles
- constraint bundles
- model bundles

Assembly output is always a canonical PersonaSpec candidate that must still
satisfy PersonaSpec validation rules.

## Canonical Admission Rules

Validation enforces strict canonical admission semantics against the opifex
PersonaSpec contract:

- Required fields: `id`, `description`, `prompt`, `model`, `capabilities`, `spec_version`
- Optional fields: `can_spawn`, `model_params`, `compaction_prompt`, `spec_digest`
- Rejected fields: `tools`, `side_effect_policy` — these are not canonical PersonaSpec fields
- Unknown top-level fields are rejected

Note: larva implements validation as a downstream consumer. The canonical schema
authority is opifex.

## Invariants

- `id` is stable identity
- `persona_ref` is the cross-system reference form
- `capabilities` is the only capability declaration surface (canonical, per opifex)
- `tools` is rejected — not a canonical PersonaSpec field
- approval and runtime gating stay outside larva
- concrete tool semantics stay outside larva
- `spec_digest` is computed from canonical JSON representation
- `spec_digest` excludes itself from canonical JSON representation
- larva is a downstream admission/projection layer; opifex owns the canonical contract
